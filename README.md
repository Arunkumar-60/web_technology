# web_technology

this is me redoing my undergrad web technology course assignments. assignment tasks and details are in the readme text files on the assignment folders.

task-1

All of you can create a web page for displaying your biodata. You can design the page professionally with basic HTML tags

task-2

All of you can design static web pages (Excluding Validations) for the task entitled "Student Portal" with the basic XHTML elememts. Note: All of you can design the portal with your own style.

task-3

Write a script to simulate the rolling of two dice. The script shoul use Math.random to roll the first die and again to roll the second die. The sum of two values should then be calculated. [Note: Since each die can show an integer value from 1 to 6, the sum of the values will vary from 2 to 12, with 7 being the most frequent sum, and 2 and 12 the least frequent sums. Your program should roll the dice 36,000 times. Use one dimensional array to tally the numbers of times each possible sum appears. Display the result in an XHTML table. Also determine whether the totals are reasonable (for instance, there are six ways to rolla 7, so approximately 1/6 of all the rolls should be 7).]

Write a script that runs 1000 games of craps and answer the following questions: i. How many games are won on the first roll, second roll, ...., twentieth roll and after the twentieth roll? ii. How many games are lost on the first roll, second roll, ...., twentieth roll and after the twentieth roll? iii. What are the chances of winning at craps? Note: you should discover that craps is one of the fairest casino games. What do you suppose this means? iv. What is the average length of a game of craps? v. Do the chance of winning improve with the length of the game?

A parking garage charges a $2.00 minimum fee to park for up to thee hours. The garage charge is an additional $0.50 per hour for each hour or part thereof in excess of three hours. The maximum charge for any given 24-hour period is $10.00. Assume that no car parks for longer than 24 hours at a time. Write a script that calculate and displays the parking charges for each cusomer who parked a car in this garage yesterday. You should input from the user the hours parked for each customer. The program should display the charge for the current cusomer and should calculate and display the running total of yesterdays receipts. The program should use the function calculateCharges to determine the charge for each customer. Use a tax input field to obtain the input from the user.

task-4

Use CSS absolute positioning, onmousedown, onmousemove, onmouseup and clientX/clientY prperties of the event object to create a program that allows you to drag and drop image. When the clicks the image, it should follow the cursor until the mouse button is released.

task-5

Design Dynamic web pages effectively (using XHTML, CSS, DOM and JavaScript) of an E- Ticketing System and provide validations for web pages if any required, the website should consist the following pages, home page with required info, registration and user login, user profile page, ticket booking page with required fields, validating the fields, fee payment options, ticket confirmation, maintain history and transactions information, logout page.

task-6

Implement a java script program to replace every element of a given array with the least great element on its right or with -1 if there are no greater element. For ex: if the input array with elements {10,100,93,32,35,65,80,90,94,6} then the output must be {32,-1,94,35,65,80,90,94,-1,-1}.

Implement a JavaScript program to reverse a given string using recursive function. For ex: if the input string is “welcome to nitap” then output must be produce “patin ot emoclew”.

Implement a java script program to print MxN matrix in to spiral order. For Ex: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
Then output must be 1 2 3 4 5 10 15 20 25 24 23 22 21 16 11 6 7 8 9 14 19 18 17 12 7 8 13.
